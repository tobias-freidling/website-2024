## About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher at École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne at the [Chair of Biostatistics](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biostat/) held by [Mats Stensrud](https://matsjst.github.io/index.html).

I am broadly interested in developing statistical methods to advance data analysis under realistic assumptions, particularly in causal inference.

Before joining EPFL, I completed my PhD degree at the [Statistical Laboratory](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/) of the University of Cambridge under the supervision of [Qingyuan Zhao](http://statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/) and obtained a Master in Mathematics at TU Munich advised by [Mathias Drton](https://www.math.cit.tum.de/en/math/people/professors/drton-mathias/).

Beyond this, I also undertook industry projects in the implementation of RNNs with Tensorflow, Bayesian optimal experimental design and detection of synthetically lethal gene pairs based on CRISPR knock-out experiments.
