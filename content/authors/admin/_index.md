## About Me

I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge supervised by [Qingyuan Zhao](http://statslab.cam.ac.uk/~qz280/).
My current research focuses on causal inference, sensitivity analysis and randomization inference.

Beyond this, I undertook industry projects in the implementation of RNNs with Tensorflow, Bayesian optimal experimental design and detection of synthetically lethal gene pairs based on CRISPR knock-out experiments. I am also a consultant at Cambridge's [Statistics Clinic](https://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/clinic/).

In 2025, I will join [Mats Stensrud](https://matsjst.github.io/index.html)'s group at EPFL as a postdoctoral researcher.
